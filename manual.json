    "ADOPTION OF 2 CFR PART 200 City of Superior adopted the Federal grant regulations provide in 2 CFR Part 200 Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), including the procurement standards, effective January 1, 2018.  FISCAL YEAR OF CITY  City of Superior shall operate on a fiscal year that begins on January 1 and ends on December 31.   BASIS OF ACCOUNTING AND MEASUREMENT FOCUS City of Superiors year-end government-wide, proprietary fund, and fiduciary fund financial statements are prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial statements.  Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.  Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied.  Grants and similar items are recognized as revenues as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider have been met. Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the City considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due. Revenues susceptible to accrual include intergovernmental grants, intergovernmental charges for services, public charges for services and interest. Other revenues such as licenses and permits, fines and forfeits and miscellaneous revenues are recognized when received in cash or when measurable and available. As a general rule the effect of inter-fund activity has been eliminated from the government-wide financial statements. Accounting transactions will be processed and reports produced on SunGard Accounting Software. 10                ",

    "DEFINITIONS  The following definitions shall apply with respect to the policies described in this manual: BID Formal written responses by vendors to the Citys solicitation for prices of goods and or services.  Bids are usually in response to formal requests for proposal (RFPs) by the City, and their formats are often specifically prescribed so as to meet precise requirements of the RFP.  Information provided in a bid may be binding against the vendor.  Bids are awarded based on the lowest cost bid received by a responsive/responsible bidder with exceptions as noted in the City of Superior Code of Ordinances Sec. 2-378 and Sec. 2-381. CASH Cash includes currency on hand in petty cash funds or change funds, demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions, and deposits in other kinds of accounts or cash management pools that have the general characteristics of demand deposit accounts in that the governmental entity may deposit additional cash at any time and also effectively may withdraw cash at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash in lock boxes or on hand at December 31 but not receipted for at that date should also be reported as cash. CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under this definition. Original maturity means the original maturity to the entity holding the investment.  CONDITION A donor-imposed stipulation that specifies a future and uncertain event whose occurrence or failure to occur gives the promisor a right of return of the assets it has transferred to the City or releases the promisor from its obligation to transfer its assets.  In practical terms, this means a donor has imposed some type of stipulation other than a purpose or time period stipulation (which is defined as a restriction below) and that condition has some degree of uncertainty as to whether or not it will occur, and if the condition is not met, the City is not entitled to the contribution.  Conditions may or may not be within the control of the City.  CONTRIBUTION An unconditional transfer of cash or other assets to the City, or a settlement or cancellation of the City's liabilities, in a voluntary nonreciprocal transfer by another entity or individual.",

    "RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT  OVERVIEW Receivables represent amounts due to the City for goods furnished or services provided before the end of the reporting period and include amounts that are significant and measurable.  If a receivable is outstanding at December 31, and is determined to be collectible, the amount will be reported on the financial statements as of the fiscal year-end. The City records all grant receivables and income as grant revenue is earned and billed/reimbursement requested during the grant year. For proprietary and fiduciary fund statements, and the government-wide statements, revenue that is earned and measurable is recognized at the same time receivables are reported (full accrual accounting).  For governmental fund statements, amounts earned and collected within 60 days are considered available and are reported as revenue and a receivable.  Amounts that are earned, but collected after 60 days are not reported as revenue, but are reported as a receivable and deferred inflow of resources (modified accrual). See the Revenue Recognition Policies for additional information. RECEIVABLE MONITORING AND RECONCILIATIONS  On a monthly basis, the Finance Department will reconcile a detailed accounts receivable report (showing aged, outstanding invoices by payer) to the general ledger.  The Finance Director will review the reconciliation and ensure that all differences are immediately investigated and resolved. The Assistant Finance Director and applicable Department Head are responsible for monitoring budget-to-actual grant expenditures throughout the grant year, and will meet quarterly with the Finance Director to discuss grant fiscal results. CREDITS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  From time to time, credits against accounts receivable from transactions other than payments and bad debts will occur.  Examples of other credits include returned products and adjustments for billing errors.  An employee who is independent of the cash receipts function will process credits and adjustments to Accounts Receivable, and all credits shall be authorized by the Finance Director. 47               ",

    "LOBBYING  LOBBYING ACTIVITIES DEFINED Lobbying activities conducted by the City may be either direct or indirect.  Direct lobbying activities consist of attempts to influence legislation through communication with any member or employee of a legislative body (federal, state, or local levels) or, if the principal purpose of the communication is lobbying, with any government official or employee who may participate in the formulation of the legislation.  Direct lobbying occurs when employees of the City or paid lobbyists communicate directly in attempts to influence legislation.  Lobbying is distinguishable from advocacy activities, which involve efforts to advocate certain positions which may have legislative implications, as long as a nonpartisan analysis of the relevant facts is performed.  Lobbying occurs only when there is a specific piece of legislation or legislative proposal pending that the City is attempting to influence.  Therefore, lobbying is considered to have taken place only if both of the following elements are present: 1. The communication refers to specific legislation (legislation that has been introduced or a specific legislative proposal that the City supports or opposes), and 2. The communication reflects a view on the legislation (supporting or opposing it). Indirect lobbying involves communications with the general public (rather than directly with legislators, etc.) where the communication includes the same two preceding characteristics, plus it encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the specific legislation (by contacting legislators, etc.). SEGREGATION OF LOBBYING EXPENDITURES  No lobbying expenditures may be charged directly or indirectly to any federal award (i.e., the City must have a nonfederal source of funds to which such lobbying costs can be charged). Accordingly, City of Superior segregates all direct and indirect lobbying expenditures in a separate section of the chart of accounts in the general ledger.  Where appropriate, lobbying expenditures shall also be allocated their fair and reasonable share of employee benefits and other allocated costs in accordance with cost allocation policies described elsewhere in this manual. 64            ",

A well-managed accounts payable function can assist in accomplishing this goal from the purchasing decision through payment and bank account reconciliation.  The following are general policies for accounts payable:     Assets or expenses and the related liability are recorded by an individual who is not responsible for ordering and receiving.  The amounts recorded are based on the contractor invoice for the related goods or services.  The contractor invoice should be reviewed and approved by a Department Head or Supervisor depending upon the amount of expenditure prior to being processed for payment.  Invoices and related general ledger account distribution codes are reviewed prior to posting to the subsidiary system. The primary objective for accounts payable and cash disbursements is to ensure that:    Disbursements are properly authorized. Invoices are processed in a timely manner. Contractor credit terms and operating cash are managed for maximum benefits. RECORDING OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE        All valid accounts payable transactions, properly supported with the required documentation, shall be recorded as accounts payable in a timely manner. Accounts payable are processed on a weekly basis.  Information is entered into the system from approved invoices or disbursement vouchers with appropriate documentation attached.   Only original invoices will be processed for payment unless duplicated copies have been verified as unpaid by researching the contractor records.   Invoices received via email will be printed, date-stamped, and initialed by an accounting clerk.   Any additional copies of the emailed invoice will be deleted.  No payments will be made from contractor statements.

City of Superior shall utilize the criteria described in Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) No. 62, in determining whether a lease is capital or operating in nature.  Under those criteria, a lease shall be treated as a capital lease if, at the time of entering into the lease, any of the following factors are present: 1. 2. 3. 4. The lease transfers ownership to the City at the end of the lease term. The lease contains a bargain purchase option. The lease term is equal to 75% or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property.  However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25% of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion should not be used for purposes of classifying the lease. The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the leased property (using, as the interest rate, the lesser of the City's incremental borrowing rate or, if known, the lessor's implicit rate). All leases that do not possess any of the four preceding characteristics shall be treated as operating leases.  In addition, all leases that are immaterial in nature shall be accounted for as operating leases. REASONABLENESS OF LEASES  City of Superior assesses the value of leases according to the requirements of 2 CFR Part 200.465, Rental Costs of Real Property and Equipment, considering the following factors;    The rate is reasonable when compared to similar property in the same area; The rate of any alternatives; and The type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the property leased.

    "PENSIONS GENERAL POLICY  In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, the City recognizes pension costs when employment services are provided, rather than when the pensions are funded.   PLAN DESCRIPTION The WRS is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan. WRS benefits and other plan provisions are established by Chapter 40 of the Wisconsin Statutes. Benefit terms may only be modified by the legislature. The retirement system is administered by the Wisconsin Department of Employee Trust Funds (ETF). The system provides coverage to all eligible State of Wisconsin, local government and other public employees. All employees, initially employed by a participating WRS employer on or after July 1, 2011, and expected to work at least 1200 hours a year (880 hours for teachers and school district educational support employees) and expected to be employed for at least one year from employee's date of hire are eligible to participate in the WRS. CONTRIBUTIONS Required contributions are determined by an annual actuarial valuation in accordance with Chapter 40 of the Wisconsin Statutes. The employee required contribution is one-half of the actuarially determined contribution rate for general category employees, and Executives and Elected Officials.  The City will not pay the employee required contribution unless provided for by an existing collective bargaining agreement. PENSION LIABILITY VALUATION The City will obtain actuarial valuations of the total pension liability at least every two years.  If a valuation is not performed as of the measurement date, the total pension liability will be based on update procedures to roll forward amounts from an earlier actuarial valuation.  The earlier valuation will have been performed as of a date that is no more than 30 months and 1 day prior to the Citys most recent fiscal year-end.   The assumptions underlying the determination of the total pension liability and related measurers will be made in conformity with Actuarial Standards of Practice, issued by the Actuarial Standards Board and disclosed in the Notes to the Basic Financial Statements. 117             ",

For proprietary funds, the liability relating to general obligation bonds that are to be repaid (principal and interest) from the proceeds/revenues generated by a specific proprietary fund, will be reported as a liability of that fund. The intended source for repayment (revenues generated from a proprietary fund rather than general resources of the City) is the factor determining when a liability for GO bonds will be classified as a fund-specific liability. ISSUANCE COSTS Bond issuance costs for a governmental fund will be reported as an expenditure when costs are first incurred and will be expensed in the government-wide financial statements, with the exception of prepaid insurance which will be the only cost reported as an asset and expensed over the life of the bond on the government-wide financial statements.  Bond issuance costs for a proprietary fund will be expensed when incurred, with the exception of prepaid insurance which will be the only cost reported as an asset and expensed over the life of the bond.  The City will use the effective interest method to amortize these costs, unless the straight-line amortization method produces similar results.

    "EQUITY  GOVERNMENT-WIDE STATEMENT The equity section (as previously defined in the Definitions section of this manual) of the government-wide statements is displayed in three components: Net investment in capital assets- consists of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, reduced by the outstanding balances of bonds, mortgages, notes, or other borrowings that are attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets. Restricted net position- consists of restricted assets reduced by liabilities and deferred inflows of resources related to those assets.  Net position should be reported as restricted when constraints placed on net position use are either:   Externally imposed by creditors (such as through debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments Imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.  Unrestricted net position- consists of the net amount of the net position, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources that are not included in the determination of net investment in capital assets or the restricted component of net position. DETERMINING LEGAL ENFORCEABILITY According to Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 46, Net Assets Restricted by Enabling Legislation, legal enforceability means that a government can be compelled by an external party  such as citizens, public interest groups, or the judiciary  to use resources created by enabling legislation only for the purposes specified by the legislation.  Generally, the enforceability of an enabling legislation restriction is determined by professional judgment, which may be based on actions such as analyzing the legislation to determine if it meets the qualifying criteria for enabling legislation, reviewing determinations made for similar legislation of the government or other governments, or obtaining the opinion of legal counsel. However, enforceability cannot ultimately be proven unless tested through the judicial process, which may never occur.  The determination of legal enforceability should be based on the underlying facts and circumstances surrounding each individual restriction. The determination that a particular restriction is not legally enforceable may lead a government to reevaluate the legal enforceability of similar enabling legislation restrictions, but should not necessarily lead a government to conclude that all enabling legislation restrictions are unenforceable. If resources are used for a purpose other than those stipulated in the enabling legislation or if there is other case for reconsideration, governments should reevaluate the legal enforceability of the restrictions to determine if the resources should continue to be reported as restricted.",
